# EcoEats
A web application driven to deliver sustainable food in an effort to make the world a better place by exclusively delivering food within a 10-mile radius! 

## Inspiration
Our main inspirations were other food delivery applications such as Uber Eats and DoorDash which revolutionized the way people access and enjoy food. We recognized the convenience and efficiency these platforms offer but also saw an opportunity to make a meaningful impact on the world. Taking inspiration from these delivery apps, we set out to reimagine the universal concept of food delivery with a focus on sustainability. Rather than just replicating the existing model, we aimed to create a platform that not only delivers delicious meals to your doorstep but also aligns with eco-conscious values. 

## Functionality
EcoEats is the ultimate dining companion for environmentally-conscious food lovers. Our app seamlessly merges sustainability and convenience, making it effortless to discover and support nearby eco-friendly restaurants. As you navigate our multi-stage order form, powered by cutting-edge technology like the Google Maps API, you'll effortlessly find the best eco-friendly dining options and predict delivery times. With sleek aesthetics and responsive design, EcoEats is not just a webpage; it's a commitment to a greener, tastier future.

## Challenges
While developing our application, there were many bumps along the road. Connecting the API was an immense adversity for us as we had never used the Google Maps API before, but we managed to successfully implement it. Unsurprisingly, making the website look good took lots of time and CSS debugging. We also faced had trouble implementing Flask with our HTML pages and SQL databases. 

## Lessons Learned
Over the course of this week, we learned all kinds of new skills relating to HTML, CSS, JS, Python, and SQL. By creating our very own database to store and validate user login, we learned new techniques on how to collect and store data properly. In addition, our expertise with CSS increased tremendously after having to create an application that not only had good functionality but also looked aesthetic.

## What's Next for EcoEats
In the future, EcoEats will strive to use even more protocols in order to increase the impact of beneficial sustainable food all around the United States. We will also implement work on our order forms so that users can order specific menu items directly from our website! Finally, we are going to work towards creating a bot that can email the Cardholder so that they can have another confirmation of their order.
